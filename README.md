## Analysis of Emergency calls in Montgomery Country, PA

This project was completed as an exploration of large data sets and natural language processing techniques.
Please review the Jupyter notebook for Exploratory Data Analysis, Machine Learning, and some TensorFlow for NLP.
Our model is able to predict with abnormally high accuracy the type of emergency each call is classified as.
This is abnormally high because the text data is extremely rich, collected in such a way that makes prediction very easy.
